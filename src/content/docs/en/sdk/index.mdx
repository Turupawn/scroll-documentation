Scroll SDK allows anyone to quickly deploy an instance of the Scroll zkEVM and its rollup architecture for deploying an L2 on Ethereum.

Although we haven't publicly launched the repo, we're working with a number of clients, technology parters, and service providers to build the most robust ZK stack for Ethereum.

In the short-term, you'll be able to run and L2 on Ethereum with a similar configuration to Scroll's mainnet.

In the medium term, Scroll SDK will allow for robust customization of an L2 or L3, including customizing its DA layer, base/settlement layer, native gas token, bridge logic, and more. Our goal is to build a robust stack focused on sovereignty and adaptability, with simple upgradability and flexible proof generation, all without locking new chains into shared governance, common asset pools, or business-source licensing.
Scroll pulls together research and engineering from Blockchain Protocols and Zero Knowledge Cryptography. If you want to dive deeper, keep reading and check out the additional resources.
