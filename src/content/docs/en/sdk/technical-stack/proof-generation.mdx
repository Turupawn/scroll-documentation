{/* Info about running the Ansible script for proof generation (and eventually using external prover partners) will go here. */}

Currently, Scroll SDK requires that you run your own provers. We're actively working with proof generation platforms to make proof generation as easy as providing an API key.

## Mock Finalization

In its default configuration, testnets can run without a ZK provers and simulate finalization. The L1 contract allows finalizing a batch without a valid proof, and the `rollup-relay` is configured to call the finalize method after 1 hour without a proof in the default configuration.

To change this mock finalization delay, adjust `config.toml` to change `TEST_ENV_MOCK_FINALIZE_TIMEOUT` from `3600` to the number of seconds you want to delay.

To disable mock finalization entirely, adjust `config.toml` to change `TEST_ENV_MOCK_FINALIZE_ENABLED` to `false`.

## Deploy a Prover

<Aside type="caution">
These instructions are an outline of the process, but our testing of the SDK has focused on working with external proving service providers, so may be out of date with out current SDK implementation.
</Aside>

Our automation code for deploying a prover differs from the rest of the stack. Because Kubernetes is designed to automatically manage resources, it doesn't fit as well as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for larger clusters of machines needing specific machine requirements.

The Ansible playbook for running a prover is available in the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/tree/develop/ansible/playbooks).

### Prequisities

- One ubuntu server with at least 256GB memory, 32 cores, and a GPU with at least 20GB memory.
- One user with `sudo` access, no password, and all permissions -- or you can change the [shared-vars.yaml](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/blob/develop/ansible/playbooks/vars/shared-vars.yaml) to add the `ansible_become_password` variable in your file.

### Configuration

- Change the values of `rpc` for `mainnet` or `sepolia` in [shared-vars.yaml](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/blob/develop/ansible/playbooks/vars/shared-vars.yaml) to your own.
- Set the values of `release_version` and `docker_tag` -- this is determined by the `coordinator` service.
- Set the values in [inventory](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/blob/develop/ansible/playbooks/inventory/provers) for your `sepolia|mainnet' and 'chunk|batch' provers.
- Optionally, set the values of `pj_path` in [shared-vars.yaml](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/blob/develop/ansible/playbooks/vars/shared-vars.yaml) -- the default is `/prover/go-prover-docker`, but can be changed to the value you want to customize.

### How to deploy your prover

Be sure to set the correct value for the `export` statements below when setting environmental variables. _Do not include brackets._

```bash
export env=[mainnet|sepolia]
export type=[chunk|batch]
export user=[your_ssh_user]

ansible-playbook  --ssh-extra-args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' --private-key $your_key  prover-bootstrap.yaml  -u $user -e env=$env -e type=$type -i inventory/provers

# Reboot your prover manually, and finally launch this playbook
ansible-playbook  --ssh-extra-args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' --private-key $your_key  prover-deploy.yaml  -u $user -e env=$env -e type=$type -i inventory/provers
```
